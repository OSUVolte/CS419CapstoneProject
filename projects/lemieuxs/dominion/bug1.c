/*
Bugs:

1. cardtest1 found my bug where the smithy card causes the player to draw an extra card.
2. cardtest2 comes across my bug where the adventurer card counts the smithy card as a treasure card.
3. The adventurer card is not added to the played pile after being played.
4. While playing Feast, if a player tries to gain a card costing more than 5 coins, an infinite loop is encountered.


(I commented out some of the assertions in my code so that I could get an accurate code coverage measurement.)
