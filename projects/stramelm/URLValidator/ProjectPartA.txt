explain testIsValid() function:
-------------------------------

testIsValid() is an overloaded function

  The first version returns void and accepts two input arguments.  It makes
  calls to the second version of testIsValid() and to setUp(). 
  
  The second version of testIsValid accepts two arguments.  The first argument
  is an array of arrays of ResultPair[] objects, which consist of partial URLs
  and true/false values indicated their validity.  The second argument is an
  option for how URLValidator should proceed.

  Inside testIsValid(Object[], long):
    - create instance of UrlValidator object
    - create different URL's which are combinations of the different elements of
      the five arrays of ResultPair[] objects
        1. testUrlScheme [length = 9]
        2. testUrlAuthority [length = 19]
        3. testUrlPort [length = 7]
        4. testPath [length = 10]
        5. testUrlQuery [length = 3]

-------------------------------
how many total URLs is it testing?
-------------------------------

On the surface the answer would appear to be 9*19*7*10*3 = 35910.
However, when we inserted a counter it was only 8*19*7*10*3 = 31920.
The code doesn't test the URL's starting with empty strings (which is the last
element in testUrlScheme[]).

-------------------------------
give an example of a valid URL being tested
-------------------------------

http://www.google.com:80/test1?action=view

-------------------------------
give an example of an invalid URL being tested
-------------------------------

http://www.google.com:80/..?action=view

-------------------------------
how is it building all the URLs?
-------------------------------

The code cycles through the elements of the five arrays of ResultPair[] objects
and creates unique URLs by appending the different elements of each array.

For example:

firstURL =
  testUrlScheme[0] +
  testUrlAuthority[0] +
  testUrlPort[0] +
  testPath[0] +
  testUrlQuery[0]

secondURL =
  testUrlScheme[0] +
  testUrlAuthority[0] +
  testUrlPort[0] +
  testPath[0] +
  testUrlQuery[1]

A complete list of all 31920 URLs can be found in the file urls_tested.txt in
the same folder as this one.

-------------------------------
are these tests very different than unit/card tests we
  wrote in terms of concepts & complexity?
-------------------------------

The concepts are similar because we are feeding in different valid and invalid
inputs including boundary conditions and we are able to compare the output to
expected results.

The tests are less complex in the sense that we are just doing simple string
validation compared to dominion that is working with objects and has greater
chance of more serious errors include memory allocation and read errors that
drive segmentation faults.

Additionally, the results are simple boolean values.  In the dominion testing
the results are game states (structs) with multiple variable attributes.
