Apache URL Validator Testing
 
URL Validator Test Explained
Apache Commons provides several packages to validate the integrity of user inputs. The 
section that we focus on in this project is the UrlValidator class. The primary function 
that performs the actual URL validation through levels of testing is testIsValid() method. 
First, the function creates a UrlValidator object and uses it to run the test on a given 
input URL against five different categories–scheme, authority, port, path, and query–to see 
if it matches any of them. The submethod call for this process is isValid(). There are two 
URLs used as test cases in the testIsValid() method: 

http://www.google.com and http://www.google.com/

The “result” part of the test is just running these inputs through isValid(). The “expected” 
part is done by breaking the URL into smaller chunks (testPartsIndex()) and running through 
all possible character permutations to see if they are valid, then reassembling the URL back 
to its original state. The boolean variables “result,” and “expect,” are then compared via 
the assertEquals() method. If the expected result matches the actual result outputted from 
the isValid() method, the program prints out “.”. Otherwise, it prints out “X”. The function 
setup() simply sets the parts index to 0.

URL Component Inputs
The test loops through five variables: scheme, authority, port, path and query. These represent 
the separate components of a URL. Each component has the following test values/options:
	Scheme: 9 – protocol inputs (i.e. “http://”).
	Authority: 19 – test inputs for IP address.
	Port: 7 – port input format.
	Path: 10 – path inputs (i.e. “/test1/”).
	Query: 3 – query inputs (i.e. “?action=value”).
Therefore, the total number of permutations that we can test is 9 * 19 * 7 * 10 * 3 = 35910 cases. 
This is the number of URLs being tested by UrlValidatorTest. Using testIsValid() method, the URL 
“http://www.google.com” would pass as valid, and “http:www.google.com” would not.

Comparison with Dominion Game testing
From evaluating the test code from UrlValidatorTest, it’s safe to say that the testing concepts 
we used with Dominion are the same core concepts used in real world professional software testing. 
On one hand, we can test results by running random inputs through the program. On the other, we 
can test calculated, expected outputs using the same set of inputs. We can then create a tool to 
automate the process of comparing those two sets of tests. The primary differences here are the 
scope and complexity a real world software test. For the size and relative simplicity of our 
Dominion game, some combination of random testing and calculated output testing would probably 
suffice to catch the majority of important bugs. However, in the case of the URL validator, since 
the size of user population is so large, and the complexity of the potential inputs is fairly great, 
it requires much more rigorous testing. And that’s why with the UrlValidator we see the use of 
combinatorial testing.
