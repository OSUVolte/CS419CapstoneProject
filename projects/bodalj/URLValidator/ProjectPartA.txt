FINAL PROJECT PART A
Jens Bodal, Emily Snyder, William George, Rick Garnica

For Part a, You will be provided a correctly working version of URL Validator
Go through instructor video of explaining URL Validation testing. 
Explain testIsValid Function of UrlValidator test code. It is available under aburasali/UrlValidatorfolder. 
Correct filepath: cs362sp16/URLValidatorCorrect/test/UrlValidatorTest.java
There are two functions, testIsValid() and an overloaded method call for testIsValid(Object[] testObjects, long options). The method call without function parameters calls the overloaded method with the parameters testUrlParts and UrlValidator.ALLOW_ALL_SCHEMES then calls setUp(). setUp() resets the object’s propery testPartsIndex; this property is an array and all of its values will be set to 0 after running setUp().
Create Validator object with parameters ALLOW_ALL_SCHEMES and ALLOW_2_SLASHES as options
Assert validator object works on valid urls
Set statusPerLine to 60 and initialize printed to zero
If printIndex set status per line to 6
Enter do while loop
Do
Create Stringbuffer object
Set expected to true
For each item in the testPartsIndex
Set index to value in testPartsIndex 
Use ResultPair object with members item and valid to cast testObjects[testPartsIndexIndex] to ResultPair array named part
Append item from testObjects[testPartsIndexIndex].item to testbuffer
Make expected = ResultPair object valid parameter && expected 
So if ResultPair object valid is false expected is false and vice versa
Continue until url is constructed
Set stringbuffer to url variable as string
Use isValid member of URLvalidator class is valid and set result to result
If result is true, output valid url
If printStatus is true and printIndex is false check if both result and expected are true, if so print a period, if not an X
Increment printed
If printed is either 6 or 60 print new line and set printed to zero
While
You can still increment the test parts index
If printStatus is true print a new line
 


Give how many total number of urls it is testing. 
Scheme: 9
Authority: 19
Port: 7
Path: 10
 // Path Options: 15 - not being used, commented out testIsValid(testUrlPartsOptions, options)
Query : 3 
9 * 19 * 7 * 10 * 3 = 35,910
1,890 valid URLs displayed in console

Explain how it is building all the urls. 
	In order to create composite URLs for testing it breaks them down into four parts: 
<scheme>://<authority><path>?<query>
Each of these four parts must be correct in order for the composite URL to be correct. The URL validator creates a series of pairs for each of these parts which each holds whether that piece is valid individually. When they are put together to form a composite URL it can then test whether it is valid as a whole. There are further path options that can be tested to verify in instances when two slashes are allowed, but this option is commented out in the testIsValid function.

Give an example of valid url being tested and an invalid url being tested by testIsValid() method.
	Valid: http://www.google.com:80
	Not valid: http://www.google.com:-1 
Do you think that a real world test (URL Validator's testIsValid() test in this case) is very different than the unit tests and card tests that we wrote (in terms of concepts & complexity)? Explain in few lines. 
A real world test, such as URL Validator’s testIsValid() test, is not very different than the unit tests and card tests that we have written.  Our unit tests were designed to test specific aspects of the dominion code to ensure that the constraints of the game were being adhered to and that other changes in the code would not affect other areas of the code as it is worked on. That is not to say that the URL validator testIsValid() method is identical in nature however. It performs many functions before testing an aspect of the program, which is sometimes necessary to ensure that the code being tested conforms to the requirements needed. The primary goal of a unit test is to test a specific functionality in its entirety and it would appear that the testIsValid() method accomplishes this through its implementation. 
	
Submit a file called ProjectPartA.txt with your writeup. You can submit the file under the folder URLValidator within your ONID directory. (How to setup this folder will be explained soon.)
