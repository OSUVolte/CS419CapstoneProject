Part a : Review of existing test case(s)(Part a is team project)

Explain testIsValid function.
The function testIsValid() first calls the function testIsValid(testObjects, options),
which does the real work of the function. The function starts off by testing some hard
coded URLs to make sure they are valid. It then builds some URLs from different parts
that have been hard coded into the ResultPair array. The program knows which URLs should
and shouldn’t pass (that information was also hard-coded in) and this allows it to compare
expected results with actual results.

How many URLs is it testing?
testUrlScheme: 9
testUrlAuthority: 19
testUrlPort: 7
testPath: 10
testUrlQuery: 3
The total number of query strings being tested is 9 * 19 * 7 * 10 * 3 = 35,910.
If an option is passed, the program will test an addition 15 strings in the combination. 
These are held in the testUrlPathOptions and would result in a total of 538650 tests.

How is testIsValid building all the URLs?
It creates a test buffer from StringBuffer(). It then combines the ResultPair[] parts
into testBuffer utilizing all possible permutations to test whether or not there is a
valid combination. When building the URLs, the program also notes if any of the parts would
result in an invalid URL so it knows what outcome to expect.

Give an example of a valid URL and an invalid URL being tested.
A valid URL the program will test: http://www.google.com/test1
An invalid URL the program will test: http://go.1aaa:80/test1//file
